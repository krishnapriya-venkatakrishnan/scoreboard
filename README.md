## Scores Calculation Logic

### Initializing Scores
- Scores for both teams are initialized to 0.

### Logic
- There are three score buttons for the home team and three score buttons for the guest team.
- Based on the buttons clicked, the scores are added to the respective teams.

### Event Handlers
- Each button has an `onclick()` event handler.

### Note
- As and when the score is calculated, the highest scoring team is highlighted using the `highlight()` function.
